# Price Predictions of Second-Hand Cars (ongoing)

## Introduction
The goal is to optimize my search for second-hand cars using data science.

Below are the three car models that interest me:

- Kia Sorento
- Mazda CX-5
- Toyota Rav4

I will use the inventory of these three cars in a 500-mile radius around my zipcode to train an algorithm to estimate the price of a given car based on its characteristics (year, mileage, trim).

## Data Collection
There are several options:
- Web scraping of Carmax.com
- Web scraping or API of Cars.com
- Web scraping or API of Edmunds.com

Cars.com displays more features (color, transmission, drivetrain) on the first page of results than Carmax.com or Edmunds.com. 
However, features are sometimes missing.
